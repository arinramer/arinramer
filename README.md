Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a software engineer who studies full stack web development and specializes in JavaScript, React, Node, and Python. I love building interactive and aesthetically appealing websites, and am looking to continually expand my knowledge and expertise.

I'm currently seeking opportunities in web development, looking to join a company that creates a vibrant, growth-oriented environment, where I can learn from my coworkers, am encouraged to ask questions and can feel confident that my contributions are valuable. My lifelong curiosity and passion for troubleshooting technological problems has sharpened my problem solving skills and my communication skills, both of which I believe are valuable tools that can be used anywhere. I'm extremely excited to begin a long and fruitful career in software development where I can apply my knowledge and continue to learn and grow.
