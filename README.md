Hi! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Arin Ramer and I'm a recent graduate of Lambda School, a 9 month long technical training program specializing in web development and computer science fundamentals, with a focus on group project work that mimics the product development lifecycle. I was in the web track, where I learned JavaScript, React, Redux, Node.js, Express, and Python.
